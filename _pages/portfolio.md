I've worked as a Technical Content Writer at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com) for a total of one and a half years. 

I crafted SEO content, thought leadership articles, and narrative-driven case studies for the company's content marketing efforts.

Besides that, I composed the company newsletter, wrote blog posts covering hiring, product launch announcements, and internal and external events. 

My work captured the publishing process from end to end- it involved talking to multiple people like project managers, developers, the delivery team and the SEO folks to get information and SEO inputs, and collaborating with designers to produce visuals.  

Here's some of my best work-

## Case studies-

1. [Powering Grist’s award-winning journalism with custom development, content syndication, and Parse.ly analytics](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/grist-managed-wordpress/) 
2. [AEM to WordPress Migration for Manheim](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/aem-to-wordpress-migration-for-manheim/)
3. [Custom CMS to WordPress Migration for Everyday Carry](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/custom-cms-to-wordpress-migration-for-everyday-carry/)

## Newsletter: 
- [Monthly Roundup May 2024](https://rtcamp.com/blog/monthly-roundup-may-2024/)

## Something Creative:

I also did some [UX writing for a Google project](https://ashutoshbhosale.com/blog/what-i-learned-working-on-a-google-project).


Before rtCamp, I wrote affiliate marketing content for The Drive. [Here's my author page](https://www.thedrive.com/authors/ashutosh-bhosale).

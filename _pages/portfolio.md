WIP. 

I've worked as a B2B content writer for one and a half years in total at a WordPress agency called rtCamp. Here are a few  samples of my work.

## Case studies-

I usually got rough drafts from either Project Managers or other writers, which I then took to the finish line. Beyond writing and editing, I would talk to PMs, developers, and the delivery team to extract information, as well as work with designers to produce visuals.

Rewriting and editing:

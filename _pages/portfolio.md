I've worked as a Technical Content Writer at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com) for a total of one and a half years. 

I composed the company newsletter, wrote blog posts covering hiring, product launches, internal and external events, and other announcements.

I also crafted SEO content, thought leadership articles, and narrative-driven case studies for the company's content marketing efforts. 

My responsibilities included but were not limited to:
- collaborating with designers to produce visuals
- talking to project managers, developers, the delivery team and the SEO folks as needed to produce pieces  

Here's some of my best work-

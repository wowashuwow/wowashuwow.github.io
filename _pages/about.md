Let me break the ice by talking about my hobbies. I like strength training, running, photography, reading fiction, tinkering with technology (this website is a result of that), swimming, dressing well, motorcycles, fast cars, and of course, writing. I like waaaaay too many things. 

In my free time, I day-dream about becoming a successful creator and do B2B writing to make money. I believe work is something you do for leisure after you live your life, not the other way around. 

How did I get into writing? Well, it's a long story, but here's a tl;dr version-

Three years into my engineering degree, I had had enough. So I dropped out to pursue my life-long dream of becoming a writer. Granted I didn't write any New York Times bestsellers, but I did pretty okay as a content writer. Two years into it, it suddenly dawned on me that I'm no Bill Gates, so I went back to college and got that piece of paper. 

Now I work at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/) as a "Technical Content Writer." Hate the job title but love the work. _(Technical Content Writer? Sounds so boring, aargh!)_

I love talking about fitness, books, films, [TV](https://ashutoshbhosale.com/tv-list), and building websites. Shoot me a message at ***ab (at) ashutoshbhosale (dot) com*** and I'll be sure to get back to you.

## About this website

This website is a constantly-evolving art project, a place of solace for my mind, an avenue for self-promotion. It's my home on the internet that keeps going through multiple servers, CMSes and designs as I keep experimenting.

It is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. I'm finding GitHub pages extremely cost-effective (it's free! lol), plus I get to play coder / hacker and build my web dev skills.

Childhood photos are natural icebreakers, aren't they?

Oh wait, there's some left. Let me just...

There. Much better. No ice.

Now, if you want the short version,

I'm a **Creative Copywriter** helping **B2B SaaS** businesses (products AND agencies) grow with the help of high quality **content, communication, and UX copy**. My writing is designed not just for CRO, but for your customers and partners to have a **better brand experience** with your company. 

If you like [my work](/work/) and would like to hire me, send me an email at **ab (at) ashutoshbhosale (dot) com**, and let's make good writing contribute directly to your bottom line ðŸ’ª

But you say you have an above-average attention span in this twenty-first century? I laud you. I also tell you you're in luck, because we're in the long version now, and in the long version, we have a conversation.

Why don't we start by talking about our hobbies? I like strength training, running, photography, reading fiction, tinkering with technology (this website is a result of that), swimming, dressing well, motorcycles, fast cars, TV shows, and of course, writing.

("Damn, you like waaaaay too many things, buddy." "Yeah, I know.")

What about you? What are your hobbies? (email me)

In my free time, I do [B2B writing](/work/) for work. I believe work is something you do in your free time to practice your intellect and curiosity; after you keep fit and have fun with your life. Not the other way around.

(*There isn't a single day that goes by when I don't fear being cancelled for saying what I just said, but it's important, someone needs to say it, so there, I said it.*)

**How did I get into writing?** Well, it's a long story, but this is the tl;dr version-

Three years into my engineering degree, I had had enough. So I dropped out to pursue my life-long dream of becoming a writer. I didn't end up writing any New York Times bestsellers, but I did pretty okay (money-wise), first as a freelance content writer mostly writing affiliate buying guides, and then as a full-time writer in the marketing team of a WordPress development agency. Two years into my writing journey, I realized I'm no Bill Gates, so I went back to college to get that piece of paper. I have it now, and it's still a piece of paper.

Anyway, now I work as a Creative Copywriter for B2B businesses on freelance and contract bases. (Yep, one basis, multiple bases. English can sound... suboptimal at times.)

But enough about me! What are you waiting for? Holler a hi at me on my email! Let's have an actual conversation. You could start by telling me about your [favorite TV shows](/tv-list/).

## About this website

This website is a constantly-evolving art project, a place of solace for my mind, an avenue for self-promotion. It's my home on the internet that keeps going through multiple servers, CMSes and designs as I keep experimenting.

It is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

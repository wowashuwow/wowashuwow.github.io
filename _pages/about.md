title: About this website
---

This website is a constantly-evolving art project, a place of solace for my mind, an avenue for self-promotion. It's my home on the internet that keeps going through multiple servers, CMSes, and designs as I keep experimenting.

It is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs on [Jekyll CMS](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the minimalistic [Sidey theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey). I'm finding GitHub pages extremely cost-effective (it's free! lol), plus I get to play coder / hacker and build my web dev skills.

The [Photos page](https://photos.ashutoshbhosale.com/) is hosted on [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com/), which I get as part of my [Adobe Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/) subscription.


I use two [micro four thirds (m43) mount ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system)cameras to take pictures- 
1. A [Panasonic Lumix G7](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-g7/8), launched 2016, bought in 2022, and
2. An [Olympus E-PL1](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusepl1) from 2010 that I bought second-hand in 2023.

Both cameras take stunning pictures.

I own a handful of lenses- a 42.5mm f/1.7, a 14mm f/1.7, a 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6, and my personal favorite, a 20mm f/1.7 pancake. I love the 20mm (40mm equivalent on full frame) because it's small, versatile, and sharp. All the lenses are from Lumix.

Childhood photos are natural icebreakers, aren't they?

Oh wait, there's some left. Let me just...

There. Much better.

Now, why don't we start by talking about our hobbies? I like strength training, running, photography, reading fiction, tinkering with technology (this website is a result of that), swimming, dressing well, motorcycles, fast cars, TV shows, and of course, writing.

("Damn, you like waaaaay too many things, buddy." "Yeah, I know.")

What about you? What are your hobbies? (email me)

In my free time, I do [B2B writing](/work/) for work. I believe work is something you do in your free time to practice your intellect and curiosity; after you keep fit and have fun with your life. Not the other way around.

(*There isn't a single day that goes by when I don't fear being cancelled for saying what I just said, but it's important, someone needs to say it, so there, I said it.*)

**How did I get into writing?** Well, it's a long story, but the tl;dr version is this-

Three years into my engineering degree, I had had enough. So I dropped out to pursue my life-long dream of becoming a writer. I didn't end up writing any New York Times bestsellers, but I did pretty okay as a content writer. Two years into that, I realized I'm no Bill Gates, so I went back to college to get that piece of paper. I have it now, and it's still a piece of paper.

Anyway, I now work as a Creative Copywriter for B2B businesses (freelance/contract). Email me if you're looking for one. Or even if you aren't, simply say say hi at ***ab (at) ashutoshbhosale (dot) com***. I love having conversations. You could start with your [favorite TV shows](/tv-list/).

## About this website

This website is a constantly-evolving art project, a place of solace for my mind, an avenue for self-promotion. It's my home on the internet that keeps going through multiple servers, CMSes and designs as I keep experimenting.

It is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

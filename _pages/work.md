I've worked as a Technical Content Writer at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com) for a total of one and a half years and as a freelance content writer for one year. 

At rtCamp, I composed the company newsletter, crafted narrative-driven case studies, wrote articles and blog posts for content marketing, hiring, product launches, events, and more.

Here's some of my best work-

## Case studies-

2. [AEM to WordPress Migration for Manheim](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/aem-to-wordpress-migration-for-manheim/)

I've written B2B content and copy for [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com)- I composed the company newsletter, crafted narrative-driven case studies, and wrote blog posts for content marketing and PR.

Here's some of my best work-

## Case studies:

- [Grist](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/grist-managed-wordpress/) (My personal favorite. [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/) featured it in their Partner Pulse newsletter that's sent to all partner agencies) 
- [AEM to WordPress Migration for Manheim](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/aem-to-wordpress-migration-for-manheim/)
- [Custom CMS to WordPress Migration for Everyday Carry](https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/custom-cms-to-wordpress-migration-for-everyday-carry/)

## Newsletters: 
- [Monthly Roundup May 2024](https://rtcamp.com/blog/monthly-roundup-may-2024/)

<!-- My responsibilities included but were not limited to:
- collaborating with designers to produce visuals
- talking to project managers, developers, the delivery team and the SEO folks as needed to produce pieces --> 

## Affiliate marketing:

Before rtCamp, I wrote affiliate buying guides as a freelance content writer. Here are two of my favorites from [The Drive](https://www.thedrive.com/)-

- [Best Dirt Bike Oils: Keep Your Bikeâ€™s Engine Trouble-Free](https://web.archive.org/web/20240114163943/https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/31411/best-dirt-bike-oil)
- [Best Cell Phone Boosters for RVs: Stay Connected off the Grid](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522174741/https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/30344/best-cell-phone-boosters-rvs)

(*Note: Since the articles are no longer live, I've updated the links to snapshots taken with [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), a tool that saves webpages.*)

## Get to know me

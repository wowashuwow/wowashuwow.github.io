I've worked as a Technical Content Writer at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com) for a total of one and a half years and as a freelance content writer for one year. 

At rtCamp, I composed the company newsletter, crafted narrative-driven case studies, wrote articles and blog posts for content marketing, hiring, product launches, internal and external events, and more.

Here's some of my best work-

## Case studies-

## Something Creative:

<!-- My responsibilities included but were not limited to:
- collaborating with designers to produce visuals
- talking to project managers, developers, the delivery team and the SEO folks as needed to produce pieces --> 

Before rtCamp, when I was freelancing, I wrote affiliate buying articles for [The Drive](https://www.thedrive.com/). Here are two of my favorites-

- [Best Dirt Bike Oils: Keep Your Bikeâ€™s Engine Trouble-Free](https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/31411/best-dirt-bike-oil)
- [Best Cell Phone Boosters for RVs: Stay Connected off the Grid](https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/30344/best-cell-phone-boosters-rvs)

I transferred my email setup once more. I don’t trust Zoho Mail. I experienced downtime with their service, it seems like there are issues with getting proper support, and privacy concerns as well.

I’m now on [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/). They support custom domains, [catch-all alias](https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/Using+catch-all+alias+with+own+domain), plus-addressing, pretty much all I want. And they’re good for [privacy](https://mailbox.org/en/security#data-protection). Plus they’re 100% powered by green energy. What more could you ask for? The [pricing](https://mailbox.org/en/services#tariffs) is decent as well.

The web interface looks basic and a bit outdated, but they have IMAP and SMTP support, so that’s not a problem. There’s also a full-blown office suite available, with calendar, contacts, and cloud storage. I haven’t used it yet. I might check it out sometime in the future.

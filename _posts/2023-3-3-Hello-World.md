I decided to migrate my blog from WordPress to GitHub pages to save some monies. The added benefit is that I will learn new things and develop new skills. What a win-win! I'm planning to use this website to showcase my photography too. Now I have to figure out how to bring my old data here without breaking anything. See you soon in the next post. I'm excited for this new start!

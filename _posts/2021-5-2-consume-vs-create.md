description: Thoughts on consuming vs creating, written during The Lockdown

It’s easy to consume, it’s hard to create. I think about this every day; like it’s an eternal battle going on in my head. So I’m just going to conduct an experiment. I’m going to try and post consistently for 30 days. Let’s see how it goes. If I get really stuck on a day, I will publish an empty post. Getting into the habit of hitting publish is what’s more important.

Where’s all this coming from?

For some of us (or many of us?), feeling that satisfaction of having created something is what keeps us sane. It’s definitely true for me. It is what keeps me sane. At the end of the day, I want to feel like I have done something worthwhile. With this lockdown, the difficulty is up a few levels. Weekends are just the worst. I do try to do something worthwhile though- learn something, or read a book, or just do something new. It feels so good when you’re creating something, however small that thing might be. I already feel so much better as I’m writing this post.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m grateful for what I have. I know a lot of people in this world have it a lot worse than me. It’s one of those thoughts- How does your little “problem” even matter? With people starving to death in the world all kinds of other shit? I’m grateful for what I have right now. A job, a roof over my head.

Taking some time out and writing down your thoughts makes your mind free. Clears up the clutter.

I’m migrating my site to a new server soon. It’s going to be a lot faster. I’m waiting for Monday to get the domain transferred and some other things figured out. I could’ve done it earlier, but didn’t want to launch on Friday. Just no.

I’m not satisfied with how this post looks, but I’m hitting publish. Hitting publish is what’s important. I have no idea what I’m going to write tomorrow, or the day after, or the day after that. But hey, I’ll figure it out. That’s what we do. We figure it out.

Alright! Until tomorrow!

PS. There’s this person called [Chris Lema](https://chrislema.com/blog/) who posts every day. Every single day. And he’s been doing it for a long time. That’s inspiring. I think posting every day is going to help me find answers to many questions and eventually improve my writing as well. Writing for yourself – how do you write for yourself? That’s one of the things I’m trying to figure out.

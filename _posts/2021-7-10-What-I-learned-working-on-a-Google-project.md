title: What I learned working on a Google project
---

I recently got to work on a Google project as part of my work at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/). It is an amazing feeling to know that your work is going to be seen by thousands of people all over the world. It’s also kind of scary tbh.

The most important thing I learned is that the focus is on getting stuff out the door, even if it’s not perfect. I think it’s similar to the [MVP approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product#Minimum_viable_brand_(MVB)).

Shipping things >>> Chasing perfection !!!

Another thing I learned is how you don’t worry and don’t spend too much time thinking about a problem; you just dive into it, riding on the belief that you’ll come up with a solution, and you do always come up with a solution. Now it may not always be the perfect or the most optimized solution, but it’s a solution that works, and that’s good enough.

That sounds like a great thing to apply in everyday life, doesn’t it?

PS. Yes, the primary motive of this post is to brag that I got to work on a Google project. But the takeaways still hold.

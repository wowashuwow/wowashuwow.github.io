I recently got to work on a Google project as part of my work at [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/). 

I did some UX writing for the [Web Stories plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/) for WordPress. It involved creating titles for the templates, crafting descriptions for them, and naming different components in the app. 

My work will help plugin users in choosing the right template for the job.

*I wrote that description! ☝️*

It is an amazing feeling to know that your work is going to be seen by thousands of people all over the world. It’s also kind of scary tbh. 

*(Update: The plugin has over 100,000 active installations as of July 10, 2024!)*

The most important thing I learned is that the focus is on getting stuff out the door, even if it’s not perfect. I think it’s similar to the [MVP approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product#Minimum_viable_brand_(MVB)).

<center><strong>shipping things > chasing perfection!</strong></center><br>

Another thing I learned is how you don't spend too much time thinking and worrying about a problem. When you dive right in, riding on the belief that you’ll come up with a solution, you do always come up with a solution! It may not always be the perfect or the most optimized solution, but it’s a solution that works, and that’s good enough.

That sounds like a great thing to apply in everyday life, doesn’t it?
